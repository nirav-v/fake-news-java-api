## Technologies used:
Following the MVC paradigm, the back-end models and controllers were configured using Java and the Spring Boot Framework for implementing routes. MySQL was used for the database. Thymeleaf was used as the templating engine for rendering data in the view.

Coming from a primarily javaScript background, this project helped me learn a lot about the strongly typed, class based nature of the Java programming language. Consequently, it deeply enhanced my understanding of computer science and object oriented programming that will be beneficial accross various languages and frameworks that I continue to learn and imporve in.
